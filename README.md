# tkinter_app

A simple desktop application built with the following tech stacks:
- tkinter
- sqlite3 (database)

## How to run
There are 2 ways of running this app, you can either go to exe folder and clicker on 1 of the exe file (1 for adm and 1 for user).
Or type:

```
python main.py
python mainADM.py
```

## File walkthrough
- main: the main python file where we initialize the the user app
- mainADM: the main adm python file where we initialize the adm app (This is where we manage the user database, parking lot database)
- rest of the files: the rest of the files without ADM at the end are files for the user application. The ones with ADM at the end are for adm application
